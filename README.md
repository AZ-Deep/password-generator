#password-generator
This is a simple python program that gives you a random password, and a strong one for that matter, for you to use for your accounts. I made this because I want a password that will improve
my accounts security so I could feel more secure and I want my passwords to be as private and personal as possible.

##Technologies used
Python
Tkinter

###Installation
You will need Tkinter for this so install Tkinter and if you already have Tkinter just import it.

####Usage
Password-generator can be useful for people who are keen on security like me! Run the program and just follow the instructions/prompt in the console app. It can give you some strong
password with customizable length/characters for a better account protection.

#####Features
Generates random passwords with customizable length.
Creates and gives you strong passwords consisting of letters, numbers and even special characters.
Console-based program.
